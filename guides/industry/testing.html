                <h3>What is Quality Assurance Testing?</h3>
                <p>
                    Quality Assurance Testing is the process of verifying a product's functionality, validating that the product benefits the customer, and ensuring that the product is not prone to errors.
                    In game development, QA testing focuses on verifying implementation of game features, validating that the game is fun to play, and ensuring that there are no egregious bugs or glitches.
                    QA is handled by a team of producers, engineers, analysts, and testers to ensure quality of the title.that work in tandem with the development team.
                </p>

                <h3>What is a QA Tester?</h3>
                <p>
                    A QA Tester, also known as a Game Tester, is an entry level QA postion whose job is to perform manual testing of a game that's in development.
                    Often, you will perform adhoc testing around certain game features, or run specific test cases to verify functionality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If any bugs are found during testing, then the a bug report is submitted to a bug tracking database.
                    Producers will triage new bugs, quickly assessing whether a bug is valid, and sending it to the appropriate dev team to be fixed.
                    Once a bug is fixed, it gets sent back to the testers to regress and verify that the fix was implemented.
                    If a bug is verified to be fixed by a tester, then the bug will be closed out.
                    However if a bug is still occuring, then the bug report will be sent back to the developers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Types of test strategies include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Test cases: Performing a specific set of steps and verify that a specific result occurs.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Attacks: Performing directed adhoc testing around a specific feature or aspect of a game.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Scenarios: Playing an area of the game under a certain set of conditions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Tour: Exploring and freely adhocing over a wide area of the game.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes, testers will be asked to participate in playtests and provide feedback to the developers about the game from a customer's point-of-view.
                    If a testers has the apptitude for programming, they may be given the opportunity to make tools or scripts for the project.
                    Occasionaly, production will make special requests that involve gathering game footage, accumulating performance data, checking if sections of the game are too difficult, etc.

                <h3>Release Candidate</h3>
                <p>
                    The Release Candidate is the game build that satisfies all the platform requirements and is free of any critical bugs.
                    Sony’s Playstation, Microsoft’s Xbox, and Nintendo systems each have their own guidelines for legal, technical, and performance requirements.
                    Distribution platforms, such as Valve's Steam Store and The Epic Games Store, have a set of guidelines as well, and are less strict than the console guidelines.
                    Testers will perform compliance testing to ensure the game will pass a platform's compliance verification.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once a Release Candidate is submitted and approved, it will be the version of the game that will be released to the market.
                    This includes the version released at launch, and any subsequent versions of the game released as an update.
                    For the physical version, a copy of the build is sent to manufacturers to be printed on disks then shipped out to retail stores.
                    For digital versions, a copy of the game is uploaded to digital distribution platforms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the advent of digital downloads and patching, games will often ship with major bugs that couldn’t be fixed before the game was sent off to be printed to disk.
                    So development and testing will continue, often all the way up to the release date, so that a patch containing major fixes can be downloaded at launch.

                <h3>The Upside of being a Game Tester</h3>
                <p>
                    Game Testing is one of the few avenues into the Games industry that does not require prior experience.
                    Through game testing, you will also start to build a better understanding of games development and production.
                    Its a good way to learn new skills, work with industry standard hardware and software, and start making professional connections.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Quality Assurance has evolved into its own specialized department in the Games Industry.
                    Depending on a tester’s skills, aptitude, and career interests, they have the opportunity to further pursue a career as a: QA producer, QA engineer, or QA analyst.
                    Alternatively, a tester may pursue other career paths in game design, engineering, production, artistry, customer support, or community management.

                <h3>The Downside of being a Game Tester</h3>
                <p>
                    Even though your work in quality assurance is critical to the game’s quality and shippability, it is often considered the least valued from a business standpoint.
                    Because of the notion that “anyone can be a game tester”, the bar is very low to qualify.
                    Testers will often start working for minimum wage because of a studio's need to maximize test coverage while minimizing the cost of testing the game.
                    Often, game testers are hired as temporary contract workers instead of full-time employees, resulting in lower job security and minimal employment.
                    Testers would end up jumping from studio to studio to maintain steady employment.
                    But quality assurance suffers because of the inability to retain experience testers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes testers and developers don’t always get along.
                    Passion for the project can fog judgement and developers may feel attacked when testers submit a bug or give feedback.
                    In studios where the testers don’t interact with the developers on a daily basis, testers may feel like they are not a part of the team.
                    Concerns brought up by QA can go ignored by the development team for long periods of time.
                    Ultimately, these issues can be a detriment to the quality of the game if they do not get addressed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The amount of training and support provided to new QA testers varies from studio to studio.
                    Some studios will offer substantial onboarding and peer support, while other will offer little to no guidance.
                    The work culture of some studios will even discourages testers from learning new skills and trying to advance their career.
