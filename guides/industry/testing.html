                <h3>Working in Game Testing</h3>
                <p>
                    Game testing is an entry level position where your job is to test daily builds of a game for bugs. Often you will perform general ad-hoc of certain game features, or run specific test cases to verify functionality. Sometimes, testers will be asked to perform playtests and provide feedback on the current state of the game, providing incite and suggestions. Occasionally, testers are given the opportunity to make tools for the project, or perform a more in-depth investigation into critical issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If any bugs are found, then the bugs are submitted to a bug tracking database. Producers will triage new bugs, quickly assessing whether a bug is valid, and sending it to the appropriate dev team to be fixed. Once a bug is fixed, it gets sent back to the testers to verify the fix was implemented. If a bug is verified to be fixed by a tester, then the test managers will close out the bugs. However if a tester finds that a bug is still occuring, then the test managers will send the bug back to the dev team that worked on the fix.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All game testers are required to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement. By signing the NDA, the Tester agrees to not discuss the game they are working on. If details of a game are leaked and the culprit is discovered, the tester will be reprimanded and barred from working at the studio in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Testers also perform Compliance testing in order to approve a Release Candidate build of the game.  The Release Candidate is the game build that meets all the compliance requirements, is free of any critical bugs, and will be version of the game available on the Release Date. Compliance testing is done to make sure the game meets the strict technical requirements of First-Party console platforms, and that the game will meet the targeted game rating issued by a Ratings Board. Sony’s Playstation, Microsoft’s Xbox, and Nintendo systems each have their own guidelines for legal, technical, and performance requirements.  Ratings boards, such as the ESRB and PEGI, each describe what content is suitable for various age groups.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Compliance verification is not free and the approval process takes time. So if a game fails compliance, it can cause delays in publishing and releasing the game, along with additional cost for repeat compliance testing and verification. When the game passes compliance, The Release Candidate is approved and will be the version of the game to launch on the release date. A copy of the build is sent to manufacturers to be printed on disks and shipped out to retail stores. A copy is also uploaded to digital distribution platforms as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the advent of digital downloads, games will often ship with major bugs that couldn’t be fixed before the game needed to be sent off for publishing. So development and testing will continue  so that a patch can be sent out and downloaded at launch to fix these issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Depending on a tester’s skills, aptitude, and career interests, they have the opportunity to pursue careers as a test manager, producer, developer, or community manager role.

                <h3>The Downside of Game Testing</h3>
                <p>
                    The most obvious downside to game testing is the pay. Studios tend to pay game testers minimum wage, because it is considered to be a low skill profession. Studios need as many people to manually test the game and to find as many bugs as possible. Often, game testers are hired as temporary contract workers instead of full-time employees. So not only you don’t receive the same benefits as full employees, you don’t have the same job security as they do. As a result, game testers end up making the rounds from studio to studio in areas like the bay area to keep a steady living. Even though your work in quality assurance is critical to the game’s quality and shippability, you are the least valued member of the team and are often the first to be let go when the studio ramps down production.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes the testers and developers don’t always get along. Developers may feel attacked when testers submit a bug or give feedback. Passion for the project can fog judgement and result in a lack of professionalism. Tensions rise due to miscommunication or misinterpretation, stress is high trying to meet impending deadlines, and poor decision making from lack of sleep and over working. In studios where the testers don’t interact with the developers on a daily basis, testers can feel like they are isolated and not a part of the team. Concerns brought up by the testing team can often go ignored by the development team for long periods of time. Ultimately, these issues can be a detriment to the quality of the game if they do not get addressed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Game studios have the notion that “anyone can be a game tester”. As long as they can hold a controller, record media, and type on a keyboard, you can be a game tester. But quality assurance suffers because of the lack of experience. New testers often experience difficulties using PCs and console dev kits, are unable to troubleshoot common tech issues, can misinterpret game functionality, use inefficient testing procedures, write poor bugs, have trouble querying information in a database, withhold details testing summaries, and communicate unprofessionally. New testers often receive training on such matters and are encouraged to improve their skills quickly. But, the amount of training and support provided to new QA testers varies from studio to studio.                </p>
