                <h3>Overview and Highlights of the Industry</h3>
                <p>
                    The Video Game Industry is a subcategory of the Entertainment Industry. Talented individuals come together to create a product for the masses to enjoy and be entertained by. Much like movies, games go through similar phases of production. Scheduling the initial roadmap, budgeting, pre-production and concepting, early prototyping, ramping up hiring professionals and services, production and development, testing and reviewing, post-production and polish, marketing, release, ramp down. Unlike movies, games enter a sustainment period, providing updates, bug fixes, and additional content. For live-service games, the sustainment period is intended to be indefinite.

                    Budgets and success of games varies widely. Often, games studios funded by big publishers see widespread success. Sometimes large productions will fail and publishers have to cut their losses. Independently developed games with little to no budgets have seen both massive commercial success. While some indie games with millions of dollars are commercial flops. Or maybe game sales or player-base is small at first, but slowly ramps up overtime as the game is updated and word of mouth spreads.                </p>
                <p>
                    Games are sold on a variety of devices. Serious Games is often considered to be games sold on PC and Console platforms. Casual Games are games distributed on mobile devices or on web-platforms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Games are either released for free or at a set price tag. The game is then supplemented with either free or paid downloadable content. The games-as-service model includes various mechanisms to entice players to continually purchase paid DLC.

                <p>
                    In 2018, the Game Industry achieved a global market value of $134 Billion dollars. It brings in more revenue than Film ($41B), Streaming Video on Demand ($22B), and Music ($19B). Gaming makes up a decent chunk of the entertainment industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Game Industry is broken up into 3 markets. Mobile (47%), PC (25%), and Console (28%).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Extra Reality Games (XR) are broken up into two subcategories, Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR). AR presents a virtual world on a 3D space using a device’s camera. VR lets the user see a virtual world from a first person perspective using a stereoscopic head-mounted display.
