                <h3>How to Get a Job in the Game Industry</h3>
                <p>
                    In the Game Industry, studios are interested in hiring talented professionals to make a commercial product. The development team’s goal is to make a game that is fun and enjoyable. The business team’s goal is to reach as many consumers as possible and to turn a profit from game sales, downloadable content, and merchandising. Games take years to make, so there is always risk when bringing on new people mid-development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Making games is a business, so studios want to minimize risk and maximize productivity. A majority of the vacancies in industry are for mid-level and senior-level positions. There is less incentive for studios to hire interns or junior staff because training costs time and resources. Studios want you to already have the skills necessary to do the work that needs to be done. They will not hire someone that cannot prove they are competent for a role.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Along with a lack of internships and junior positions, more and more individuals are studying game development as an education or a hobby. Therefore, there is far more competition for these entry level positions. For example, the acceptance rate for an internship at Blizzard Entertainment is less than 1%. So you have to make your application standout from the rest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recruiters are looking for individuals that meet the job requirements, and can make personal connections. They will toss out any job application that doesn’t have a genuine cover letter and a portfolio of your past works. Describe your abilities or aptitude, talk about your personal experiences, and make a connection as to how your skills would be a good fit for the job. You want to portray yourself as the solution to their problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In your portfolios, show that you can program the systems that the studio needs programmed. Show that you can make art in the same art style and quality as the studio. Show that you can manage a project under a tight schedule with great organization and detail. Show that you can market games to a target audience. Show that you can manage a community and have excellent communication skills. Show that you can test games and find bugs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you currently do not have the education or skills to fulfill a developer or business role but still want to work in the Game Industry, you can work in other entry level roles. These include game testing, customer service, IT desktop support, and various facility roles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another avenue is to attend conventions. Conventions give industry professionals and fans the opportunity to come together and mingle in one place. Most conventions, such as PAX and E3, are catered more towards the fans and the marketing of upcoming games. Yet developers are present and you do have the chance to talk with them. There are also a few networking events that are held during the same week as the conventions. Your best bet for career networking in the Game Industry is at GDC, the Game Developers Conference. Companies are actively seeking to recruit individuals and do interviews on the spot. You will want to put your best foot forward and present yourself as the best candidate for an open position.

                <h3>Departments in the Game Industry</h3>
                <p>
                    There are many departments in the games industry than just game programming and art. But, there are plenty of other roles within a game studio that most people might not be aware of. Or, people might need more insight into what are the roles available within a certain discipline.
