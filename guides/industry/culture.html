                <h3>Culture in the Game Industry</h3>
                <p>
                    In recent years, there have been a lot of articles documenting the toxic work culture in the Game Industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Studios are taking advantage of developer’s passions and encouraging unpaid overtime. Management and peers pressure developers to participate. If you don’t, then are looked down on for not being passionate enough. Also, if you choose not to work unpaid overtime, you are more likely to be let go when the project ramps down. Crunch time lasts for a couple weeks to several months and can heavily impact work-life balance. Constantly working for 50 to 100 hrs a week can lead to fatigue from lack of sleep and mental breakdowns from heavy stress. Eventually, game developers burnout and leave the industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Only 22% of developers are women, yet those that are present have to put up with sexual harassment at studios that exhibit bro culture. Nobody should have to deal with the problems female employees faced like at Riot Games and Rockstar Games.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Developers and testers can also run into a lot of frustrations. Especially when the contracted or external and rarely interacts with the development team. This can lead to feelings of isolation and resentment as with testers at Treyarch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some studios have a tendency to let go of staff without much warning. It takes time to find a new job and get hired, so being let go on such short notice can leave you financially insecure for an unexpected period of time, like at Telltale Games. Also, businesses are always open to reducing the bottom line, even when a company is making record revenue. Large swaths of staff are fired for restructuring only for the company to rehire new employees for lower pay, as with Activision Blizzard. Game Testers often are brought on enmasse and let go after 9 to 12 months. Often, companies list contract positions because they don’t have to provide benefits and don’t have to rehire them after the alloted period, like with Electronic Arts and Epic Games. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    All these issues in the Game Industry have led many to believe that now is the time to push for unionization.

                <h3>Crunch and Game Development (WIP)</h3>
                <p>
                    Crunch is a period of overtime that can last between a few weeks to several months before a game's release.
                    Crunch is a common occurrence in both AAA and indie game development.
                    Although Crunch is voluntary, it is heavily encouraged that all developers participate in it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because of the creative nature of game development, some believe Crunch is an inevitable part of the Games Industry.
                    Others believe that with proper planning, decision making, and business flexibility, Crunch can be avoided.
                    Either way, passion and business success are both key factors as to why Crunch occurs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Several reasons why Crunch occurs:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            You made big promises to your fanbase through crowdfunding stretch goals.
                            Developers Crunch in order to meet the release deadline and give fans everything that was promised.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Developers Crunch from the start because the money raised from the crowdfunding campaign will only last for a specific amount of production time and the business can't afford extensions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Developers decide to change to a new engine, but the toolset is incomplete for the game genre they are making.
                            Engineers have to make new tools as quickly as possible, while designers struggle to work with a buggy toolset.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If the studio does not meet the publisher's release schedule, they may not be contracted again in the future.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            All throughout production, design and narrative are constantly changing due to creative differences and lack of a cohesive vision.
                            Once design is set, everyone is scrambling to make a game before the release date.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Creative direction changes drastically midway into production.
                            Much of the game is scraped and now more work needs to be done.
                            Even with the extensions, developers are still Crunching all the way to the finish line.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Everyone in the studio is passionate about the project they want to prove to the rest of the world that they can make bigger and better games.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            As a solo indie dev working on a project of massive scope there is no one holding you accountable for your work ethic.
                            Through blind passion, you spend every waking hour working on the game.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Business leadership imposes a new creative vision, leaving designers and engineers scrambing to implement these sudden changes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Due to studio turmoil, a majority of the developers are working on a game not approved by the publishing partner.
                            Eventually, the publisher has to step in and stop the insubordination, and now the entire studio is Crunching to meet the release deadline for the approved game.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            As the release date approaches, the team is working feverishly to fix every last bug.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            On launch, the audience criticizes the game on multiple fronts and leave the development team dazed and confused.
                            Developers Crunch to get new designs implemented as quickly as possible issues as possible to recapture the good graces of their fans.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <h3>Unionizing the Game Industry</h3>
                <p>
                    In order to combat the issues of unpaid overtime, job insecurity, unfair wages, discrimination, and sexual harassment, a grassroots advocacy group started called Game Workers Unite. GWU’s goal is to encourage game industry workers around the world to unionize.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unionization will allow Game Industry workers to take collective action in negotiating work hours, pay scales, and benefits with their employers. Union representatives can also help workers to take legal action for underpayment, harassment, and wrongful termination.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In France, the STJV was formed as an independent union for workers in the video games industry. 
                    In the UK, Game Workers Unite UK was formed as a branch of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB). 
                    Their purpose is to fight for better working conditions and benefits, provide legal assistance, organize strike against employers, improve diversity and inclusion, and maintain job security. 
                    The benefits of a union greatly outway the costs, with the aim of bringing about a healthier environment for game developers.
