                    <h3>Marketing and Release</h3>
                    <p>
                        Marketing and advertising is critical to a game's success.
                        The goal is to convert as many people within your target audience into buyers.
                        Your team can make the most amazing game possible, but if nobody knows about it, then no one will play it.
                        There are multiple avenues to spreading the word about your game and it’s development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A publisher or marketing agency will assist your studio with traditional marketing and advertising.
                        Publishers can assist with getting news coverage and reviews of your game through games media outlets.
                        Publishers can also showcases your game at conferences, digital video promotions, and post about the game on their social media accounts.
                        Publishers and marketing agencies can assist with creating cinematics, gameplay trailers, and screenshots for your website, store pages, or advertisements.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you don't have the capital, you can take a more grassroots approach to your marketing.
                        You can build up hype and grow an audience by: posting devlogs, making screenshots and gifs, showing game trailers, telling friends and family, launch a crowdfunding campaign, upload demo builds, or partnering with Let’s Players to showcase your game.
                        Word-of-mouth is powerful, and has the potential to make your game go viral.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Community engagement also helps with growing and maintaining an audience.
                        By making connections with people in your community, people with become more emotionally invested in your journey and the game that your team ends up creating.
                        Hold active discussions in comments of posts, in dedicated forums or chat rooms, and/or broadcast live streams regularly to keep the community engaged.
                        Your community can also help with marketing efforts if they decide to share your game to others.
                        The community can also be a good predictor to how successful the game will be when released.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Especially for multiplayer games, hosting Alpha and Beta Testing sessions can be a good way to acquire users early on.
                        Successful testing sessions can potentially increase the user growth substantially.
                        Early players can help find major issues in the game as well as provide critical feedback.
                        Using the feedback from the test session, you can rebalance gameplay or introduce changes that improve the quality of life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rarely, games are released with little-to-no marketing and simply go viral because the game is either so good, or so bad, that they want other people to play it.
                        You should not expect your game will succeed on its own.
                        If you want to ensure your game has a successful launch, market it before and after it releases.

                    <h3>Post Mortem</h3>
                    <p>
                        You’ve finished your game and released it to market.
                        Sales numbers are rolling in and you see a surge of active users.
                        Your team gets word from the community of various bugs and glitches.
                        Critics and users write reviews and provide feedback.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Or, the project was a complete mess.
                        Production was plagued by delays due to mismanagement and ran over budget.
                        Team members couldn't work together and constantly argued over creative differences.
                        Maybe you had to cancel development because the project ran out of money.
                        Or maybe you still managed to release the game, but was met with poor sales and scathing reviews.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Post Mortems are meant to be a learning opportunity for team members.
                        Ask questions such as: Did the team meet the original production schedule?
                        Did the team have to Crunch and/or delay the release?
                        Was production within budget?
                        Does the game that was created match the original creative vision?
                        Is the team satisfied with the results?
                        Are players satisfied with the results?
                        Did you reach your projected sales goals?
                        How was the game received by the audience?
                        What parts of the development process worked well?
                        What mistakes were made along the way that could've been avoided?
                        What processes could be improved and implemented in future projects?
                        Is there any work that was completed that can be reused for future projects?
                        Does the team feel like they can continue working together on future projects?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s important to learn from the experience and for everyone to provide constructive criticism.
                        Nobody is perfect, and there is plenty of room for growth.
                        Take what you learned and apply it to improve the success of future projects.
