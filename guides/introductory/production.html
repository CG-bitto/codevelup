                    Q: What Engine, Frameworks, Libraries, APIs, SDKs, Programming Languages, and Tools do I use?<br>
                    </span>
                    A: Pick the tools that will make developing your game easier.
                    It does not matter what tools you use to make your game, what matters is making it.
                    If you know what type of game you are making, then find a toolset that is tailored for making your game.

                    Q: I’ve never programmed before and want to make games. Where do I start?<br>
                    </span>
                    A: Learn to program while making your game with a Game Engine.
                    There are tons of tutorials and documentation for introductory game engine programming.
                    Google search for tutorials on how to program game mechanics or systems.
                    Search for questions you have in forums or on Q/A hubs, it is very likely someone else has already asked them.
                    If you can't find the answer you are looking for, then post a question in the Q/A hubs or forums.

                    Q: I'm a programmer. Should I build my own Game Engine / Framework for making my game?<br>
                    </span>
                    A: No. If you want to be a game developer, then make games. Do not make a Game Engine. An Engine is a tool to make game creation easier. Some engines are general-purpose, and provide a standard set of tools and functions to create any type of game. Other engines are specialized and come equipped with tools to make a game for a specific genre. If an engine lacks the functionality you need, modify the engine’s source code or create a plugin. 
                    Only make a game engine if: all the available engines aren’t suitable for making your game, you want a specialized tool to make your game, you plan on reusing your engine to make sequels or similar games, you want to be a professional Engine Programmer, or you are adamant about avoiding royalties for using a commercial engine.

                    Q: Are there other ways to program a game without learning a programming language?<br>
                    </span>
                    A: Some engines use visual scripting systems to make it easier for designers and artists to program game logic.

                    <span class="bold">
                    Q: I'm using a general-purpose Game Engine, and I don’t want to spend time programming key game systems. What should I do?<br>
                    </span>
                    A: Purchase plugins for an engine from their respective marketplace or asset store. Many people work on extending the functionality of an engine to save others time and speed up the development process.

                    Q: I want to make a game, but I don’t want to program it. What do I do?<br>
                    </span>
                    A: Team up, hire, or contract a programmer.

                    </span>
                    A: For unique and custom assets, team up with an artist, hire an artist, contract a freelancer, or contract an asset creation service. Alternatively, you can purchase art assets from digital marketplaces.

                    Q: Are there free tools and assets?<br> 
                    </span>
                    A: There are plenty of free tools and assets available for download. Most game engines are free so you can start development right away. A lot of asset creation tools are free or offer free trials. There are also many websites that provide free assets for anyone to use to make games.

                <h3>Recruiting Team Members</h3>
                <p>
                    If you plan on making your game with a team, start by listing out the team's various roles.
                    Determine what tasks each role is responsible for, and how many individuals are needed for each role.
                    After you've decide what roles you want to play, you can start recruiting additional members to fill the remaining roles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are several websites, subreddits, forums, and discord servers where teams advertise their projects and individuals advertise their services.
                    The best way to start recruiting is by making a post in these communities, or to contact individuals directly who are open to joining a team.
                    Alternatively, you can attend local game developer meetups and ask attendees if they are interested in working on your project.
                    If you are having trouble recruiting people, then consider contracting freelancers instead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In your recruitment posts, the more details you provide about the project, the more likely people will inquire and join your team.
                    Describe the premise, the genre, the roles that are available, what each role is responsible for, the estimated production time, and minimum time commitment per week.
                    Also, make it clear if you are offering compensation and what form of compensation. (Unpaid, revenue-share, hourly payment, or commission based payment)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Factors to consider while recruiting members are experience, location, time zone, and availability.
                    Less experienced individuals will be willing to work for free, but may lead to slower production.
                    More experienced individuals will expect payment for their high skill labor, especially if your project requires a significant time commitment. 
                    Working with people locally allows you to meet up in person, which makes it easier for people to motivate each other and hold each other accountable for progress.
                    Working remotely will require more leadership and management to make sure team members are on task.
                    It will also take more time for team members to trust each other and maintain moral on the project.
                    Working with people in the same time zone also makes it easier to synchronize the production schedule and ensure everyone is working around the same time.
                    Working with people in different time zones is possible, especially those on different continents, but it can cause a substantial delay in communications and take a lot of effort to manage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you make people to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) before divulging any about the game, then people are less likely to contact you about your project.
                    The lack of information about the project will inhibit your ability to recruit the right individuals for your team.
                    People become skeptical when they don't know what you are getting them into and will likely result in wasted time for both parties during the interview process.
                    While an NDA is a good way to keep your business a secret, it can make it more difficult to recruit the right people for the project.
                </p>

            <div id="experience" class = "guide">
                <h3>Team Size and Experience</h3>
                <p>
                    The team’s skill level will determine whether implementing certain features is feasible and if it can be done in a timely manner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A team comprised of inexperienced members may result in poor implementation of complex features, or could lengthen development time as they learn new skills and gather the necessary knowledge.
                    Whereas, experienced members likely already know how to build the required systems and have an easier time expanding upon them.
                    Production time will also be more predictable and move at a steadier pace with a more experienced team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are a solo dev, then production time is entirely decided by you.
                    Every aspect of the game will require your attention.
                    You will be knowledgeable in multiple areas, but the trade off is that you will not be specialized into one discipline.
                    As a result, production times will drastically increase because all tasks will have to be performed sequentially.
                    But, you have full creative control of your game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With a team of specialized individuals, tasks can be divided up and completed in parallel.
                    Multiple tasks can be finished during each iteration cycle, allowing the team to build prototypes of the game faster.
                    Smaller teams will still require members to complete tasks in several departments, but still allow development to move faster than a solo developer.
                    The final product will be a culmination of the all creative efforts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the team size increases, management of the project gets more difficult.
                    You will have to spend more time organizing task work and making sure team members have something to work on.
                    Managing efforts also helps prevents team members working on the same task by accident.

                <h3>Iterative Development</h3>
                <p>
                    Just like modern Software Development, game development is an iterative process.
                    To support rapid iteration, studios often employ an Agile model of development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The premise of Agile is to make software with a focus on the end-user experience.
                    Production is flexible and open to rapid changes in design.
                    Regular reviews of the product are done at the end of every milestone and developers evaluates what changes and improvements are necessary.
                    Through continuous iteration and collaboration, the product evolves and becomes better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the start of a project, development is brokendown into multiple milestones.
                    Each milestone has a set of features and user stories that developers work on implementing.
                    At the end of the milestone, users and testers evaluate the product.
                    Testers perform verification to make ensure the feature is implemented based on current design.
                    Users perform validation, providing praise or criticism on the User Experience.
                    Developers then review the feedback and integrate any additional design or development work into the next milestone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because video games are an artistic endeavor, designs are subject to change.
                    Features need to be built and tested, then refined based on player feedback.
                    If features are too difficult for your team to implement, then simplified or alternative designs will need to be introduced.
                    Even bugs and glitches can potentially become features or lead to other design changes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A Feature that looks good on paper may result in a horrible gameplay experience for players.
                    Along with criticism, players may also suggest improvements or changes to the existing design.
                    As the developer, you need to take this feedback and make some tough decisions:
                    Adjust existing design to improve it, implement a new design to replace it, or scrap the design entirely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to design changes, set backs, and production constraints, the game you originally envisioned isn't always going to be the game that gets shipped.
                    Your team will have to make tough decisions on what features and content to keep or cut.
                    Anything that is cut might be cut from production entirely, or set aside as a post-launch update.
                    With the advent of "Early Access" releases and the "Games as a Service" business model, developers will often continue to provide Content Updates long after a game has been released.
                    Content Updates and patches may include new features, new content, gameplay balancing, and bug fixes.
                </p>

                <h3>Production Goals</h3>
                <p>
                    A project's production goals generally include the following:                      
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Proof of Concept Prototype
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Vertical Slice
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Code Complete
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Content Complete
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Release Candidate
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Post-Launch Updates
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    A Proof of Concept Prototype is a pre-alpha build that validates the game's design.
                    It contains as much of the core components necessary to make a playable experience.
                    Any visual and audio assets are commonly placeholder and used to facilitate as much of the gameplay as possible.
                    This phase undergoes rapid prototyping to solidify the gameplay experience.
                    If the game design is deemed not fun during the early stages of development, then it will save time and money that would've been lost during full-scale production.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Vertical Slice is a polished alpha demo that showcases all of the game's core features with mostly finalized assets.
                    The demo should contain all of the gameplay experiences that a player will encounter.
                    It does not need to showcase all the content, but the content presented within the demo should be finished.
                    The levels used to make the Vertical Slice don't have to be in the final product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Code Complete is when all of the programming that makes up the game has been completed and fully implemented.
                    At this point, programmers will pivot to fixing bugs and glitches that exist in the game.
                    If there are available resources, developers can program features intended for the Desired Product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Content Complete is when all the art and audio assets have been created and implemented into the game.
                    At this point, Artists will fix or polish any issues with assets that exist in the game.
                    If there are available resources, artists and designers can continue making content for the Desired Product.

                    The Release Candidate is a finished product that contains the minimum amount of content that was planned to be released to market.
                    All features and content are complete and all critical bugs have been fixed.
                    This version of the game is considered to be the Minimum Viable Product.
                    Major and minor bugs may still exist and might get fixed either prior to getting printed to disc or as a Day 1 patch.
                    If time is available, developers can work on additional features and content.

                    After launch, developers transition into producing Downloadable Content (DLC) for Post-Launch Updates.
                    The most common updates are patches, which include bug fixes and balance changes.
                    Content updates, aka Expansions, typically include new levels, characters, and gameplay experiences.
                    Content updates can either be released for free or as paid DLC.
                    Development of Post-Launch content may follow a similar set of production goals as the ones listed above.

                <h3>Task Management</h3>
                <p>
                    Make a set of production goals that the team should accomplish every milestone.
                    In Agile, these goals are a collection of Features and User Stories.
                    A Feature is a general design principle, while a User Story is a scenario a user would expect to experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To make a rough estimate of how long it will take to produce the game, start by making rough estimates of how long it will take to produce each feature.
                    Sum up the Feature estimates, then double it to account for the time needed to iterate design, polish gameplay, and fix bugs.
                    For a more conservative estimate, triple the sum of the Feature estimates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Create a set of tasks that when completed will satisfy the corresponding Features and User Stories for each milestone.
                    Make weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly deadlines for each task and assign them out to the appropriate team members.
                    By setting deadlines, team members are held accountable for the game's production. 
                    Consistent production also helps with keeping development moving at a steady pace.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    During production, leadership should make sure the delivered work is meeting established quality standards.
                    Code might need to meet certain performance and scalability requirements.
                    Art needs to be made in a consistent style so the environment and game objects blend together seamlessly.
                    Audio has to have the right fit for the world and is of a certain fidelity.
                    Peer review helps maintain the overall quality of the work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end of the milestone, you will want to review the team’s progress and evaluate the production.
                    Was the complexity of a task not estimated correctly?
                    Were certain taks not completed before the end of the milestone?
                    Will certain features take longer to implement than originally anticipated?
                    Do team members finish their work early and have nothing left to do for the remainder of the milestone?
                    Is production on schedule for the originally planned release date? Or does the release date need to be pushed back?
                    Is a team member slacking off?
                    Did team members leave the project?
                    Do you need to recruit more members to achieve a higher production velocity?
                    Taking the time to review the game’s production will help predict the results of the next milestone and allow you to better plan out the future.
                </p>

                    There are a variety of task management applications available to help facilitate production.
                    Some are as simple as paper TODO lists, sticky note scrum boards, or digital issue lists and kanban boards.
                    Others are more complex and can encompass every aspect of production, from departments, scheduling, velocity, complexity, feature criteria, task lists, dashboards, etc. Use the system that works best for you and fits your needs.
                    Pick the method that works best for you and your team size.
