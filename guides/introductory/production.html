                    <h3>Iterative Development</h3>
                    <p>
                        Just like modern Software Development, game development is an iterative process.
                        To support rapid iteration, studios often employ an Agile model of development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The premise of Agile is to make software with a focus on the end-user experience.
                        Production is flexible and open to rapid changes in design.
                        Regular reviews of the product are done at the end of every milestone and developers evaluates what changes and improvements are necessary.
                        Through continuous iteration and collaboration, the product evolves and becomes better.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the start of a project, development is brokendown into multiple milestones.
                        Each milestone has a set of features and user stories that developers work on implementing.
                        At the end of the milestone, users and testers evaluate the product.
                        Testers perform verification to make ensure the feature is implemented based on current design.
                        Users perform validation, providing praise or criticism on the User Experience.
                        Developers then review the feedback and integrate any additional design or development work into the next milestone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because video games are an artistic endeavor, designs are subject to change.
                        Features need to be built and tested, then refined based on player feedback.
                        If features are too difficult for your team to implement, then simplified or alternative designs will need to be introduced.
                        Even bugs and glitches can potentially become features or lead to other design changes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A Feature that looks good on paper may result in a horrible gameplay experience for players.
                        Along with criticism, players may also suggest improvements or changes to the existing design.
                        As the developer, you need to take this feedback and make some tough decisions:
                        Adjust existing design to improve it, implement a new design to replace it, or scrap the design entirely.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Due to design changes, set backs, and production constraints, the game you originally envisioned isn't always going to be the game that gets shipped.
                        Your team will have to make tough decisions on what features and content to keep or cut.
                        Anything that is cut might be cut from production entirely, or set aside as a post-launch update.
                        With the advent of "Early Access" releases and the "Games as a Service" business model, developers will often continue to provide Content Updates long after a game has been released.
                        Content Updates and patches may include new features, new content, gameplay balancing, and bug fixes.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Production Goals</h3>
                    <p>
                        A project's production goals generally include the following:                      
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Proof of Concept Prototype
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Vertical Slice
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Code Complete (Alpha)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Content Complete (Beta)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Gold Master
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Post-Launch Updates
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A Proof of Concept Prototype is a pre-alpha build that validates the game's design.
                        It contains as much of the core components necessary to make a playable experience.
                        Any visual and audio assets are commonly placeholder and used to facilitate as much of the gameplay as possible.
                        This phase undergoes rapid prototyping to solidify the gameplay experience.
                        If the game design is deemed not fun during the early stages of development, then it will save time and money that would've been lost during full-scale production.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Vertical Slice is a polished alpha demo that showcases all of the game's core features with mostly finalized assets.
                        The demo should contain all of the gameplay experiences that a player will encounter.
                        It does not need to showcase all the content, but the content presented within the demo should be finished.
                        The levels used to make the Vertical Slice don't have to be in the final product.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Code Complete is when all of the programming that makes up the game has been completed and fully implemented.
                        At this point, programmers will pivot to fixing bugs and glitches that exist in the game.
                        If there are available resources, developers can program features intended for the Desired Product.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Content Complete is when all the art and audio assets have been created and implemented into the game.
                        At this point, Artists will fix or polish any issues with assets that exist in the game.
                        If there are available resources, artists and designers can continue making content for the Desired Product.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Gold Master is a finished product that contains the minimum amount of content that was planned to be released to market.
                        All features and content are complete and all critical bugs have been fixed.
                        This version of the game is considered to be the Minimum Viable Product.
                        Major and minor bugs may still exist and might get fixed either prior to getting printed to disc or as a Day 1 patch.
                        If time is available, developers can work on additional features and content.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After launch, developers transition into producing Downloadable Content (DLC) for Post-Launch Updates.
                        The most common updates are patches, which include bug fixes and balance changes.
                        Content updates, aka Expansions, typically include new levels, characters, and gameplay experiences.
                        Content updates can either be released for free or as paid DLC.
                        Development of Post-Launch content may follow a similar set of production goals as the ones listed above.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="tasking">
                    <h3>Task Management</h3>
                    <p>
                        Make a set of production goals that the team should accomplish every milestone.
                        In Agile, these goals are a collection of Features and User Stories.
                        A Feature is a general design principle, while a User Story is a scenario a user would expect to experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To make a rough estimate of how long it will take to produce the game, start by making rough estimates of how long it will take to produce each feature.
                        Sum up the Feature estimates, then double it to account for the time needed to iterate design, polish gameplay, and fix bugs.
                        For a more conservative estimate, triple the sum of the Feature estimates.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Create a set of tasks that when completed will satisfy the corresponding Features and User Stories for each milestone.
                        Make weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly deadlines for each task and assign them out to the appropriate team members.
                        By setting deadlines, team members are held accountable for the game's production. 
                        Consistent production also helps with keeping development moving at a steady pace.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        During production, leadership should make sure the delivered work is meeting established quality standards.
                        Code might need to meet certain performance and scalability requirements.
                        Art needs to be made in a consistent style so the environment and game objects blend together seamlessly.
                        Audio has to have the right fit for the world and is of a certain fidelity.
                        Peer review helps maintain the overall quality of the work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the end of the milestone, you will want to review the team’s progress and evaluate the production.
                        Was the complexity of a task not estimated correctly?
                        Were certain taks not completed before the end of the milestone?
                        Will certain features take longer to implement than originally anticipated?
                        Do team members finish their work early and have nothing left to do for the remainder of the milestone?
                        Is production on schedule for the originally planned release date? Or does the release date need to be pushed back?
                        Is a team member slacking off?
                        Did team members leave the project?
                        Do you need to recruit more members to achieve a higher production velocity?
                        Taking the time to review the game’s production will help predict the results of the next milestone and allow you to better plan out the future.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are a variety of task management applications available to help facilitate production.
                        Some are as simple as paper TODO lists, sticky note scrum boards, or digital issue lists and kanban boards.
                        Others are more complex and can encompass every aspect of production, from departments, scheduling, velocity, complexity, feature criteria, task lists, dashboards, etc. Use the system that works best for you and fits your needs.
                        Pick the method that works best for you and your team size.
