                    <h3>Draft a Recruitment Post</h3>
                    <p>
                        If you plan on making your game with a team, you're gonna have to make a layout of the team's size and various roles.
                        Determine what tasks each role will be responsible for, and how many individuals you will need for each role.
                        Once you've decide on what role you want to play, you can fill the remaining roles by recruiting additional members.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Draft a recruitment post for your project and the open roles.
                        Describe the game's premise, the game's genre, the available roles, each role's responsiblilities, skill and experience requirements, the estimated production time, and minimum time commitment per week.
                        Also, make it clear if you are offerring any form of compensation (Unpaid, revenue-share, hourly payment, or commission based payment).
                        The more detail you provide, the more likely people will inquire and join your team.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you make people sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) before divulging any details about your game, then people may be less likely to contact you about your project.
                        While an NDA is a good way to keep your business and game idea a secret, the lack of information about the project may inhibit your ability to recruit the right individuals to your team.

                    <h3>Recruit Team Members</h3>
                    <p>
                        Publish your recruitment post on game development forums, subreddits, and discord servers.
                        You can also contact individuals directly who post that they are open to joining a team.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you want to try a more in-person approach, then attend a game development meetups for local clubs or organizations.
                        You can ask other attendees if they would be interested in joining your project.
                        Even if they don't join your team, they may be able to connect you with others that might be interested in joining.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you aren't receiving contact from potential recruits through your posts, then consider directly contacting individuals that are looking for a team.
                        You can find similar posts in the same game development forums, subreddits, and discord servers.
                        Often, individuals looking for a team are freelancers, but there are those looking to join a hobby project or simply learn game development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Factors to consider while recruiting members are: experience, availabile time commitment, physical location, and time zone.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="experience">
                    <h3>Team's Experience</h3>
                    <p>
                        The teamâ€™s skill level will determine if implementing certain features is feasible and if it can be done in a timely manner.
                        Team members will also expect a certain level of compensation based on their experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While less experienced members are more likely to work for free or for revenue-share, they may spend more time learning the necessary skills to make the game.
                        Also, less experienced members may have a more difficult time implementating complex features.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Experienced members will have an easier time building the required systems and expanding upon them.
                        Development will be more predictable and move at a steadier pace.
                        But more experienced individuals will expect payment for their high skill labor, especially if your project requires a significant time commitment.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="time">
                    <h3>Team's Availability</h3>
                    <p>
                        The team's availability will determine how much progress can be made on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most people are available part-time to work on projects, so progress is often made on a weekly basis.
                        If a person that is only available a few hours out of the week, then expect monthly progress.
                        Team members that are working on the project full-time will allow for daily progress.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="location">
                    <h3>Team's Location</h3>
                    <p>
                        Working with people locally allows you to meet up in person, which makes it easier for people to motivate each other and hold each other accountable.
                        Working with people in the same time zone also makes it easier to synchronize the production schedule and ensure everyone is working around the same time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Remote teams allow team members to work on the project anytime and anywhere.
                        But remote projects require more management and leadership to make sure team members are on task.
                        Also, communications may be delayed, trust may take longer to build up, and morale more difficult to maintain.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="size">
                    <h3>Team's Size</h3>
                    <p>
                        The team's size will determine how much work can be distributed and completed in parallel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you are a solo dev, then production time is entirely dependant on your efforts.
                        While being a solo dev gives you full creative control, every aspect of the game will require your attention.
                        Production times will drastically increase because tasks can only be performed sequentially.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With a team of specialized individuals, tasks can be divided up and completed simultaneously.
                        The bigger the team, the more specialized team members become.
                        As a result, the final product will be a culmination of the team's creative efforts.
