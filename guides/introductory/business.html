                    <h3>Cost of Development</h3>
                    <p>
                        The cost of development includes both time and money.
                        To get an idea of the costs, you need to answer the following questions:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What skills are needed to develop the game?
                        How long will it take to learn the necessary skills to develop the game?
                        Will you make the game by yourself?
                        Do you need a team?
                        How will you compensate your teammates?
                        What tools will you use?
                        Do you need to purchase licenses for software?
                        What assets will you need?
                        What is the DevOps pipeline?
                        Do you need servers to host your game?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Will your game be free or paid?
                        Will you include alternative monetization methods?
                        What devices are you targeting? 
                        What distribution platforms are you going to use? 
                        What is the production schedule?
                        How will you market your game?
                        What is your planned release date?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And most importantly, How will you fund the project?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All projects require funding, whether it’s to hire professionals or just keep the lights on.
                        Most people have a day job and only have their evenings and weekends available to contribute to a project.
                        People will not dedicate themselves full-time to create a game without compensation.
                        Everyone needs to pay for expenses, and it's difficult to work on something full-time without financial security.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="funding">
                    <h3>Funding Options</h3>
                    <p>
                        If you want to work full-time on your game, there are several funding options available.
                        These include: using your savings, starting a crowdfunding campaign, partnering with publishers / investors, or applying for developer grants.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For crowdfunding, publishing, and grants, you will be required to pitch your game to whomever you are seeking investment from.
                        You will want to be able to show a solid concept, often a working prototype, detailed design descriptions, captivating screenshots or videos, a definite production deadline, a breakdown on how the money will be spent, and what will be the potential Return on Investment (monetary or product).
                        The more clear, detailed, and marketable your pitch is, the greater your chances of success.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="business">
                    <h3>Make a Business Plan</h3>
                    <p>
                        What is the business model of your game? How will you make a Return on Investment (ROI) for the costs of development? 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For hobbiests, the ROI is often the experience you gained from completing the project.
                        Your new found knowledge can be put to use in future projects.
                        You can also document the experience on your resume and portfolio site, which is valuable if you plan on pursuing a career in the Games Industry.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But businesses, they expect to turn a profit from the game's revenue.
                        What revenue model will you use?
                        What price will you sell your game at?
                        Will you also include microtransactions or a subscription?
                        Do you plan to expand the game with free or paid DLC?
                        What devices and distribution platforms are you targeting?
                        When will you break even?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But if you release a game for free and expect monetary gain, what approach will you take?
                        Are you going to sell a soundtrack, digital art assest, or physical merchandise?
                        Are you selling cosmetic goods from an in-game storefront?
                        Sell in-game currency that can be used to purchase rolls on a gacha, or speed up actions to reduce wait times?
                        Sell boosters to alleviate the amount of grinding a player has to do to progress?
                        Have a subscription that gives players rewards for their participation?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For live services, how do you maintain player retention?
                        How do you reward players and encourage them to keep playing?
                        Do you create daily, weekly, monthly objectives?
                        Do you host limited timed events that introduces additional content?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Who is your target audience?
                        Are you targeting a general audience or a more niche audience?
                        What is your marketing strategy to acquire an audience?
                        Can you do any market research to estimate the market size based previously released games?
                        Can you make any projections on revenue or user growth?
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="marketing">
                    <h3>Marketing and Release</h3>
                    <p>
                        Marketing and advertising is critical to a game's success.
                        The goal is to convert as many people within your target audience into buyers.
                        Your team can make the most amazing game possible, but if nobody knows about it, then no one will play it.
                        There are multiple avenues to spreading the word about your game and it’s development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you have a publisher or are working with a marketing agency, they will assist your studio with traditional marketing and advertising.
                        Publishers can assist with getting news coverage and reviews of your game through games media outlets.
                        Publishers can also showcases your game at conferences, digital video promotions, and post about the game on their social media accounts.
                        Publishers and marketing agencies can assist with creating cinematics, gameplay trailers, and screenshots for your website, store pages, or advertisement on websites.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you don't have the capital, you can take a more grassroots approach to your marketing.
                        You can build up hype and grow an audience by: posting devlogs, making screenshots and gifs, showing game trailers, telling friends and family, launch a crowdfunding campaign, upload demo builds, or partnering with Let’s Players to showcase your game.
                        Word-of-mouth is powerful, and has the potential to make your game go viral.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Community engagement also helps with growing and maintaining an audience.
                        By making connections with people in your community, people with become more emotionally invested in your journey and the game that your team ends up creating.
                        Hold active discussions in comments of posts, in dedicated forums or chat rooms, and/or broadcast live streams regularly to keep the community engaged.
                        Your community can also help with marketing efforts if they decide to share your game to others.
                        The community can also be a good predictor to how successful the game will be when released.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Especially for multiplayer games, hosting Alpha and Beta Testing sessions can be a good way to acquire users early on.
                        Successful testing sessions can potentially increase the user growth substantially.
                        Early players can help find major issues in the game as well as provide critical feedback.
                        Using the feedback from the test session, you can rebalance gameplay or introduce additional quality of life improvements.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rarely, games are released with little-to-no marketing and simply go viral because the game is either so good, or so bad, that they want other people to play it.
                        You should not expect your game will succeed on its own.
                        If you want to ensure your game has a successful launch, market it before and after it releases.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="postmortem">
                    <h3>Post Mortem</h3>
                    <p>
                        You’ve finished your game and released it to market.
                        Sales numbers are rolling in and you see a surge of active users.
                        Your team gets word from the community of various bugs and glitches.
                        Critics and users write reviews and provide feedback.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Or, the project was a complete mess.
                        Production was plagued by delays due to mismanagement and ran over budget.
                        Team members couldn't work together and constantly argued over creative differences.
                        Development had to stop because the project ran out of money.
                        You release what was made, and those that played the game make scathing reviews.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Post Mortems are meant to be a learning opportunity for team members.
                        Ask questions such as: Did the team meet the original production schedule?
                        Did the team have to Crunch and/or delay the release?
                        Was production within budget?
                        Does the game that was created match the original creative vision?
                        Is the team satisfied with the results?
                        Are players satisfied with the results?
                        Did you reach your projected sales goals?
                        How was the game received by the audience?
                        What parts of the development process worked well?
                        What mistakes were made along the way that could've been avoided?
                        What processes could be improved and implemented in future projects?
                        Is there any work that was completed that can be reused for future projects?
                        Does the team feel like they can continue working together on future projects?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s important to learn from the experience and for everyone to provide constructive criticism.
                        Nobody is perfect, and there is plenty of room for growth.
                        Take what you learned and apply it to improve the success of future projects.
