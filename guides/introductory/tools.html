                        </span>
                        A: Pick the tools that will make developing your game easier.
                        It does not matter what tools you use to make your game, what matters is making it.
                        If you know what type of game you are making, then find a toolset that is tailored for making your game.

                        Q: I’ve never programmed before and want to make games. Where do I start?<br>
                        </span>
                        A: Learn to program while making your game in a Game Engine.
                        Google search for introductory tutorials and documentation on game engine programming.
                        Search for guides or videos on how to program game mechanics or systems.
                        Search for answers to questions in forums or Q&A hubs, it is very likely someone else has already asked them.
                        If you can't find an answer to a question you have, then make a post about your question.

                        Q: I'm a programmer. Should I make my own Game Engine / Framework for making my game?<br>
                        </span>
                        A: No.
                        If you want to be a game developer, then make games.
                        Do not make a Game Engine.
                        An Engine is a tool to make game creation easier.
                        Some engines are general-purpose, and provide a standard set of tools and functions to create any type of game.
                        Other engines are specialized and come equipped with tools to make a game for a specific genre.
                        If an engine lacks the functionality you need, you can extend it with plugins or by modifying the engine’s source code.

                        Q: When would I make my own Game Engine?<br>
                        </span>
                        A: Only make a game engine if: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                You want to be a professional Engine Programmer.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                All the available engines aren’t suitable for making your game.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                You want a specialized tool that you own and you plan on reusing it to make sequels or similar games.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                You are adamant about avoiding royalties or subscriptions for the use of a commercial engine.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        Q: I'm using a general-purpose Game Engine, and I don’t want to spend time programming key game systems. What should I do?<br>
                        </span>
                        A: Purchase plugins for an engine from their respective marketplace or asset store. Many people work on extending the functionality of an engine to save others time and speed up the development process.

                        </span>
                        A: Some engines use visual scripting systems to make it easier for designers and artists to program game logic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="bold">
                        Q: I want to make a game, but I don’t want to program it. What do I do?<br>
                        </span>
                        A: Team up, hire, or contract programmers.

                        <span class="bold">
                        Q: I don’t want to make the art and audio for my game. What do I do? <br>
                        </span>
                        A: Team up, hire, or contract artists.
                        Alternatively, you can purchase art assets from digital marketplaces.

                        Q: Are there free tools and assets?<br> 
                        </span>
                        A: There are plenty of free tools and assets available for download.
                        Most game engines are free so you can start development right away. A lot of asset creation tools are free or offer free trials. There are also many websites that provide free assets for anyone to use to make games.
