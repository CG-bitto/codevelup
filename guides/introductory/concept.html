                    <h3>What is a Video Game?</h3> 
                    <p>
                        A Video Game is a digital interactive experience that is created by combining programming and art, where a set of rules govern how players can achieve a goal. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Video Games can be a few squares jumping on rectangles, or a massive multiplayer online open world. 
                        Art can be as simple as a few pixels, or as complex as high poly models with photorealistic textures. 
                        Audio can be a few sound bites, or a grand composition played by an orchestra. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Games have been made by individuals, small groups, and large studios that span across the globe. 
                        With a plethora of tools, assets, and services available, anyone can make a video game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Roles in game development include: engineers, producers, designers, artists, testers, composers, musicians, localizers, marketers, community managers, customer support, IT technicians, legal counselors, business administrators, accountants, facility managers, HR Reps, Recruiters, etc. 
                        All these people come together to build an experience the masses can enjoy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Game ideas are created through brainstorming sessions then fleshed out through documentation and concept drawings. 
                        Once all developers agree on the game's design, a prototype built to validate it. 
                        As production of the game progresses, the game is iterated upon. More features are built, gameplay is tested and refined, finalized art and audio is added, and bugs are fixed. 
                        In order to ensure financial success, the game is marketed to its target audience to garner a potential player base. 
                        After months or years of hard work and dedication, the game is released.
                    </p>

                <div id="startsmall">
                    <h3>What Game Should I Make?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Make the game you want to make.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Is it a clone of a popular game but with a twist?
                        Or is it a completely original game idea?
                        Do you want to make a simple 2D platformer?
                        Or do you want to make a vast 3D open world RPG with a bunch of items, cool weapons, deadly monsters, touching cinematics, heated action, and a grand story?
                    </p>
                    <p>                    
                        Feel free to go headlong into making the game of your dreams, or start out by making smaller games to gradually build up your skills.                    
                        But no matter how big or how small your game is, do not underestimate how long it takes to make a game. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By producing small games, you will more quickly grasp the game development process.
                        Smaller projects are more manageable, team members are more likely to stick around, and there is a greater chance the game will get finished and launch.
                        By failing quickly, you will be able to discover the best path for success.
                        As you complete more projects, you will gradually build up the experience and skills necessary to produce bigger games.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you are still set on making your big dream game as your first game, then make sure to break it down into smaller chunks.
                        The feeling of progress will help with maintaining your motivation to work on projects that may take years to complete.
                        By accomplishing small goals, it becomes easier to achieve big goals.
                        If you dont feel confident that you can make your big dream game yet, then take a small fraction of the features from your big game idea to make your first small game.
                        If you are whole-heartedly commited to making your big dream game, then go for it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you can't think of a game idea, then here are some common points of inspiration:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Take a proven game idea and innovate on top of it.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Reuse the same genre and mechanics from a game, but use them in a different setting.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Combine two or more genres to create a new experience that poses a different set of challenges.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Participate in a Game Jam. Often, novel game ideas come from having to brainstorm around the proposed theme.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now that you've decided on the game you want to make, let's start concepting it.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="concept">
                    <h3>Concepting the Game Idea</h3>
                    <p>
                        Start brainstorming and put your game idea on paper.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What is your game's vision?
                        What are your expectations of the player experience?
                        What emotions do you want the experience to evoke from the players?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Elaborate on all the higher level features of the game.
                        Jot down the theme, genre, goals, features, game pieces, game loop, progression, rewards, art style, type of music, target platform/s, etc.
                        Describe the setting, the game world, story, premise, lore, characters.
                        Make sketches of environments, levels, characters, and game objects to get a sense of scale and art direction.
                        Think about the audience your game is targeting and the experience you want them to have.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now that you have all the big ideas of your game on paper, the next step is to evaluate the game's scope.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="scope">
                    <h3>Evaluating Scope</h3>
                    <p>
                        Scope equates to a game’s complexity.
                        The more features and content a game has, the greater the game's scope.
                        By evaluating the scope, you can get a better idea of how big your game will be.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Take a moment to break out your Game Concept into two categories: the Minimum Viable Product, and Additional Features and Content.
                        The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is the minimum finished state the game needs to be in before it can ship.
                        The MVP includes all essential features that makes up the game (mechanics and systems), and the content the game has to offer (characters, levels, art, audio, etc).
                        Anything that doesn't need to be in the game at launch are then categorized as Additional Features and Content.
                        The sum of the MVP and the Additional Features and Content is the Desired Product.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now review the overall scope of the game and ask yourself, is the scope too big?
                        Can your team execute this game idea and create a finished product in the desired production timeframe?
                        Are there things that can be recategorized as Additional Features and Content?
                        If it comes down to it, what things would you be okay with cutting completely from the game?
                        You can always release a MVP and update it with any Additional Features and Content in future updates.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also keep in mind that your game's design is always subject to change.
                        In the event you have to redesign a feature, you will need to re-evaluate the game's scope to ensure that none of the changes severely impact your production timeline.
                        Avoid Feature Creep, which is the tendency to add a lot of new features and content to the game's design over the course of development.
                        Team members often overestimate their production capacity, and forget how much work there still is to make the MVP.
                        Try to make sure that any design changes to the MVP are not drastic, but sometimes such changes cannot be avoided.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now that you've narrowed down the scope and are committed to making your game, let's start filling in the details.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="gdd">
                    <h3>Writing a Game Design Doc</h3>
                    <p>
                        A Game Design Document (GDD) is pretty self-explantory. It's a document that contains all of a game's design details.
                        It functions as a written blueprint and can be as broad or specific as necessary.
                        At the very least, it should contain all the high level design and technical details of your game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Use the notes from your Game Concepting session to outline the Game Design Doc.
                        Elaborate on all of the rules, mechanics, systems, game objects, functionality, interfaces, control schemes, and game options.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Solidify the art style and list out the necessary 3D models, 2D graphics, textures, animations.
                        Determine the level design and the necessary environments, lighting, shaders, post processing, and particle effects.
                        Draw some concept art of the game and create references of the world establish a more cohesive theme and aesthetic of environments, set pieces, scale of the world, props, characters.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Flesh out the lore, world building, story beats, plot, narrative, script, and character interactions.
                        Storyboard  scenes and cinematics of key plot points.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Figure out what music and the sound effects are necessary for menus, actions, or event sequences.
                        Make wireframes, layouts, and flowcharts of the User Experience and User Interface.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Overall, the GDD should contain the most recent agreed upon design of the game and serve as a reference during development.
                        But, it is very likely design will change after several sessions of prototyping, playtesting, and discussing.
                        As a result, the GDD will evolve as designs are iterated upon.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With your game design and scope set for now, how are you going to make your game?
                        What are the necessary tools to make your design a reality?
