                    If applicable, engage your community at the end of the video or in the comments section to get their feedback, suggestion, and opinions on the content.

                <p>
                    Mobile games advertising is heavily scripted.
                    They are intended to manipulate the audience, get people to download the game, and buy microtransactions.
                    You can choose whether or not to accept these advertising deals, but do consider the impact it has on your community, your morality, and your video content.
