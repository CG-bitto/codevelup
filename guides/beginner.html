                <p>
                    The Beginner's Guide will take you through the overall process of game development, from conception of a game idea to post mortem of a project.
                    After reading this guide, you will have a better understanding of what you need to do to develop a video game.

                <h3>What is a Video Game?</h3> 
                <p>
                    A Video Game is a digital interactive experience that is created by combining programming and art, where a set of rules govern how players can achieve a goal. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Video Games can be a few squares jumping on rectangles, or a massive multiplayer online open world. 
                    Art can be as simple as a few pixels, or as complex as high poly models with photorealistic textures. 
                    Audio can be a few sound bites, or a grand composition played by an orchestra. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Games have been made by individuals, small groups, and large studios that span across the globe. 
                    With a plethora of tools, assets, and services available, anyone can make a video game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Roles in game development include: engineers, producers, designers, artists, testers, composers, musicians, localizers, marketers, community managers, customer support, IT technicians, legal counselors, business administrators, accountants, facility managers, HR Reps, Recruiters, etc. 
                    All these people come together to build an experience the masses can enjoy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Game ideas are created through brainstorming sessions then fleshed out through documentation and concept drawings. 
                    Once all developers agree on the game's design, a prototype built to validate it. 
                    As production of the game progresses, the game is iterated upon. More features are built, gameplay is tested and refined, finalized art and audio is added, and bugs are fixed. 
                    In order to ensure financial success, the game is marketed to its target audience to garner a potential player base. 
                    After months or years of hard work and dedication, the game is released.

                <h3>What Game Should I Make?</h3>
                <p>
                    Make the game you want to make.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Is it a clone of a popular game but with a twist?
                    Or is it a completely original game idea?
                    Do you want to make a simple 2D platformer?
                    Or do you want to make a vast 3D open world RPG with a bunch of items, cool weapons, deadly monsters, touching cinematics, heated action, and a grand story?
                </p>
                <p>                    
                    Feel free to go headlong into making the game of your dreams, or start out by making smaller games to gradually build up your skills.                    
                    But no matter how big or how small your game is, do not underestimate how long it takes to make a game. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    By producing small games, you will more quickly grasp the game development process.
                    Smaller projects are more manageable, team members are more likely to stick around, and there is a greater chance the game will get finished and launch.
                    By failing quickly, you will be able to discover the best path for success.
                    As you complete more projects, you will gradually build up the experience and skills necessary to produce bigger games.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are still set on making your big dream game as your first game, then make sure to break it down into smaller chunks.
                    The feeling of progress will help with maintaining your motivation to work on projects that may take years to complete.
                    By accomplishing small goals, it becomes easier to achieve big goals.
                    If you dont feel confident that you can make your big dream game yet, then take a small fraction of the features from your big game idea to make your first small game.
                    If you are whole-heartedly commited to making your big dream game, then go for it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you can't think of a game idea, then here are some common points of inspiration:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Take a proven game idea and innovate on top of it.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Reuse the same genre and mechanics from a game, but use them in a different setting.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Combine two or more genres to create a new experience that poses a different set of challenges.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Participate in a Game Jam. Often, novel game ideas come from having to brainstorm around the proposed theme.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now that you've decided on the game you want to make, let's start conceptualizing it.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="concept" class = "guide">
                <h3>Conceptualizing the Game Idea</h3>
                <p>
                    Start brainstorming and put your game idea on paper.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What is your game's vision?
                    What are your expectations of the player experience?
                    What emotions do you want the experience to evoke from the players?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Elaborate on all the higher level features of the game.
                    Jot down the theme, genre, goals, features, game pieces, game loop, progression, rewards, art style, type of music, target platform/s, etc.
                    Describe the setting, the game world, story, premise, lore, characters.
                    Make sketches of environments, levels, characters, and game objects to get a sense of scale and art direction.
                    Think about the audience your game is targeting and the experience you want them to have.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now that you have all the big ideas of your game on paper, the next step is to evaluate the game's scope.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="scope" class = "guide">
                <h3>Evaluating Scope</h3>
                <p>
                    Scope equates to a game’s complexity.
                    The more features and content a game has, the greater the game's scope.
                    By evaluating the scope, you can get a better idea of how big your game will be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Take a moment to break out your Game Concept into two categories: the Minimum Viable Product, and Additional Features and Content.
                    The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is the minimum finished state the game needs to be in before it can ship.
                    The MVP includes all essential features that makes up the game (mechanics and systems), and the content the game has to offer (characters, levels, art, audio, etc).
                    Anything that doesn't need to be in the game at launch are then categorized as Additional Features and Content.
                    The sum of the MVP and the Additional Features and Content is the Desired Product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now review the overall scope of the game and ask yourself, is the scope too big?
                    Can your team execute this game idea and create a finished product in the desired production timeframe?
                    Are there things that can be recategorized as Additional Features and Content?
                    If it comes down to it, what things would you be okay with cutting completely from the game?
                    You can always release a MVP and update it with any Additional Features and Content in future updates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also keep in mind that your game's design is always subject to change.
                    In the event you have to redesign a feature, you will need to re-evaluate the game's scope to ensure that none of the changes severely impact your production timeline.
                    Avoid Feature Creep, which is the tendency to add a lot of new features and content to the game's design over the course of development.
                    Team members often overestimate their production capacity, and forget how much work there still is to make the MVP.
                    Try to make sure that any design changes to the MVP are not drastic, but sometimes such changes cannot be avoided.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now that you've narrowed down the scope and are committed to making your game, let's start filling in the details.

                <h3>Writing a Game Design Doc</h3>
                <p>
                    A Game Design Document (GDD) is pretty self-explantory. It's a document that contains all of a game's design details.
                    It functions as a written blueprint and can be as broad or specific as necessary.
                    At the very least, it should contain all the high level design and technical details of your game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Use the notes from your Game Concepting session to outline the Game Design Doc.
                    Elaborate on all of the rules, mechanics, systems, game objects, functionality, interfaces, control schemes, and game options.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Solidify the art style and list out the necessary 3D models, 2D graphics, textures, animations.
                    Determine the level design and the necessary environments, lighting, shaders, post processing, and particle effects.
                    Draw some concept art of the game and create references of the world establish a more cohesive theme and aesthetic of environments, set pieces, scale of the world, props, characters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Flesh out the lore, world building, story beats, plot, narrative, script, and character interactions.
                    Storyboard  scenes and cinematics of key plot points.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Figure out what music and the sound effects are necessary for menus, actions, or event sequences.
                    Make wireframes, layouts, and flowcharts of the User Experience and User Interface.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, the GDD should contain the most recent agreed upon design of the game and serve as a reference during development.
                    But, it is very likely design will change after several sessions of prototyping, playtesting, and discussing.
                    As a result, the GDD will evolve as designs are iterated upon.

                    A: Pick the tools that will make developing your game easier.
                    It does not matter what tools you use to make your game, what matters is making it.
                    If you know what type of game you are making, then find a toolset that is tailored for making your game.

                    A: Learn to program while making your game with a Game Engine.
                    There are tons of tutorials and documentation for introductory game engine programming.
                    Google search for tutorials on how to program game mechanics or systems.
                    Search for questions you have in forums or on Q/A hubs, it is very likely someone else has already asked them.
                    If you can't find the answer you are looking for, then post a question in the Q/A hubs or forums.

                    Q: I'm a programmer. Should I build my own Game Engine / Framework for making my game?<br>
                    </span>
                    A: No. If you want to be a game developer, then make games. Do not make a Game Engine. An Engine is a tool to make game creation easier. Some engines are general-purpose, and provide a standard set of tools and functions to create any type of game. Other engines are specialized and come equipped with tools to make a game for a specific genre. If an engine lacks the functionality you need, modify the engine’s source code or create a plugin. 
                    Only make a game engine if: all the available engines aren’t suitable for making your game, you want a specialized tool to make your game, you plan on reusing your engine to make sequels or similar games, you want to be a professional Engine Programmer, or you are adamant about avoiding royalties for using a commercial engine.

                <h3>Recruiting Team Members</h3>
                <p>
                    If you plan on making your game with a team, start by listing out the team's various roles.
                    Determine what tasks each role is responsible for, and how many individuals are needed for each role.
                    After you've decide what roles you want to play, you can start recruiting additional members to fill the remaining roles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are several websites, subreddits, forums, and discord servers where teams advertise their projects and individuals advertise their services.
                    The best way to start recruiting is by making a post in these communities, or to contact individuals directly who are open to joining a team.
                    Alternatively, you can attend local game developer meetups and ask attendees if they are interested in working on your project.
                    If you are having trouble recruiting people, then consider contracting freelancers instead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In your recruitment posts, the more details you provide about the project, the more likely people will inquire and join your team.
                    Describe the premise, the genre, the roles that are available, what each role is responsible for, the estimated production time, and minimum time commitment per week.
                    Also, make it clear if you are offering compensation and what form of compensation. (Unpaid, revenue-share, hourly payment, or commission based payment)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Factors to consider while recruiting members are experience, location, time zone, and availability.
                    Less experienced individuals will be willing to work for free, but may lead to slower production.
                    More experienced individuals will expect payment for their high skill labor, especially if your project requires a significant time commitment. 
                    Working with people locally allows you to meet up in person, which makes it easier for people to motivate each other and hold each other accountable for progress.
                    Working remotely will require more leadership and management to make sure team members are on task.
                    It will also take more time for team members to trust each other and maintain moral on the project.
                    Working with people in the same time zone also makes it easier to synchronize the production schedule and ensure everyone is working around the same time.
                    Working with people in different time zones is possible, especially those on different continents, but it can cause a substantial delay in communications and take a lot of effort to manage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you make people to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) before divulging any about the game, then people are less likely to contact you about your project.
                    The lack of information about the project will inhibit your ability to recruit the right individuals for your team.
                    People become skeptical when they don't know what you are getting them into and will likely result in wasted time for both parties during the interview process.
                    While an NDA is a good way to keep your business a secret, it can make it more difficult to recruit the right people for the project.

            <div id="experience" class = "guide">
                <h3>Team Size and Experience</h3>
                <p>
                    The team’s skill level will determine whether implementing certain features is feasible and if it can be done in a timely manner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A team comprised of inexperienced members may result in poor implementation of complex features, or could lengthen development time as they learn new skills and gather the necessary knowledge.
                    Whereas, experienced members likely already know how to build the required systems and have an easier time expanding upon them.
                    Production time will also be more predictable and move at a steadier pace with a more experienced team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are a solo dev, then production time is entirely decided by you.
                    Every aspect of the game will require your attention.
                    You will be knowledgeable in multiple areas, but the trade off is that you will not be specialized into one discipline.
                    As a result, production times will drastically increase because all tasks will have to be performed sequentially.
                    But, you have full creative control of your game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With a team of specialized individuals, tasks can be divided up and completed in parallel.
                    Multiple tasks can be finished during each iteration cycle, allowing the team to build prototypes of the game faster.
                    Smaller teams will still require members to complete tasks in several departments, but still allow development to move faster than a solo developer.
                    The final product will be a culmination of the all creative efforts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the team size increases, management of the project gets more difficult.
                    You will have to spend more time organizing task work and making sure team members have something to work on.
                    Managing efforts also helps prevents team members working on the same task by accident.

                <h3>Iterative Development</h3>
                <p>
                    Just like modern Software Development, game development is an iterative process.
                    To support rapid iteration, studios often employ an Agile model of development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The premise of Agile is to make software with a focus on the end-user experience.
                    Production is flexible and open to rapid changes in design.
                    Regular reviews of the product are done at the end of every milestone and developers evaluates what changes and improvements are necessary.
                    Through continuous iteration and collaboration, the product evolves and becomes better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the start of a project, development is brokendown into multiple milestones.
                    Each milestone has a set of features and user stories that developers work on implementing.
                    At the end of the milestone, users and testers evaluate the product.
                    Testers perform verification to make ensure the feature is implemented based on current design.
                    Users perform validation, providing praise or criticism on the User Experience.
                    Developers then review the feedback and integrate any additional design or development work into the next milestone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because video games are an artistic endeavor, designs are subject to change.
                    Features need to be built and tested, then refined based on player feedback.
                    If features are too difficult for your team to implement, then simplified or alternative designs will need to be introduced.
                    Even bugs and glitches can potentially become features or lead to other design changes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A Feature that looks good on paper may result in a horrible gameplay experience for players.
                    Along with criticism, players may also suggest improvements or changes to the existing design.
                    As the developer, you need to take this feedback and make some tough decisions:
                    Adjust existing design to improve it, implement a new design to replace it, or scrap the design entirely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to design changes, set backs, and production constraints, the game you originally envisioned isn't always going to be the game that gets shipped.
                    Your team will have to make tough decisions on what features and content to keep or cut.
                    Anything that is cut might be cut from production entirely, or set aside as a post-launch update.
                    With the advent of "Early Access" releases and the "Games as a Service" business model, developers will often continue to provide Content Updates long after a game has been released.
                    Content Updates and patches may include new features, new content, gameplay balancing, and bug fixes.
                </p>

                <h3>Production Goals</h3>
                <p>
                    A project's production goals generally include the following:                      
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Proof of Concept Prototype
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Vertical Slice
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Code Complete
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Content Complete
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Release Candidate
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Post-Launch Updates
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    A Proof of Concept Prototype is a pre-alpha build that validates the game's design.
                    It contains as much of the core components necessary to make a playable experience.
                    Any visual and audio assets are commonly placeholder and used to facilitate as much of the gameplay as possible.
                    This phase undergoes rapid prototyping to solidify the gameplay experience.
                    If the game design is deemed not fun during the early stages of development, then it will save time and money that would've been lost during full-scale production.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Vertical Slice is a polished alpha demo that showcases all of the game's core features with mostly finalized assets.
                    The demo should contain all of the gameplay experiences that a player will encounter.
                    It does not need to showcase all the content, but the content presented within the demo should be finished.
                    The levels used to make the Vertical Slice don't have to be in the final product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Code Complete is when all of the programming that makes up the game has been completed and fully implemented.
                    At this point, programmers will pivot to fixing bugs and glitches that exist in the game.
                    If there are available resources, developers can program features intended for the Desired Product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Content Complete is when all the art and audio assets have been created and implemented into the game.
                    At this point, Artists will fix or polish any issues with assets that exist in the game.
                    If there are available resources, artists and designers can continue making content for the Desired Product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Release Candidate is a finished product that contains the minimum amount of content that was planned to be released to market.
                    All features and content are complete and all critical bugs have been fixed.
                    This version of the game is considered to be the Minimum Viable Product.
                    Major and minor bugs may still exist and might get fixed either prior to getting printed to disc or as a Day 1 patch.
                    If time is available, developers can work on additional features and content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After launch, developers transition into producing Downloadable Content (DLC) for Post-Launch Updates.
                    The most common updates are patches, which include bug fixes and balance changes.
                    Content updates, aka Expansions, typically include new levels, characters, and gameplay experiences.
                    Content updates can either be released for free or as paid DLC.
                    Development of Post-Launch content may follow a similar set of production goals as the ones listed above.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="tasking" class = "guide">
                <h3>Task Management</h3>
                <p>
                    Make a set of production goals that the team should accomplish every milestone.
                    In Agile, these goals are a collection of Features and User Stories.
                    A Feature is a general design principle, while a User Story is a scenario a user would expect to experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To make a rough estimate of how long it will take to produce the game, start by making rough estimates of how long it will take to produce each feature.
                    Sum up the Feature estimates, then double it to account for the time needed to iterate design, polish gameplay, and fix bugs.
                    For a more conservative estimate, triple the sum of the Feature estimates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Create a set of tasks that when completed will satisfy the corresponding Features and User Stories for each milestone.
                    Make weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly deadlines for each task and assign them out to the appropriate team members.
                    By setting deadlines, team members are held accountable for the game's production. 
                    Consistent production also helps with keeping development moving at a steady pace.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    During production, leadership should make sure the delivered work is meeting established quality standards.
                    Code might need to meet certain performance and scalability requirements.
                    Art needs to be made in a consistent style so the environment and game objects blend together seamlessly.
                    Audio has to have the right fit for the world and is of a certain fidelity.
                    Peer review helps maintain the overall quality of the work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end of the milestone, you will want to review the team’s progress and evaluate the production.
                    Was the complexity of a task not estimated correctly?
                    Were certain taks not completed before the end of the milestone?
                    Will certain features take longer to implement than originally anticipated?
                    Do team members finish their work early and have nothing left to do for the remainder of the milestone?
                    Is production on schedule for the originally planned release date? Or does the release date need to be pushed back?
                    Is a team member slacking off?
                    Did team members leave the project?
                    Do you need to recruit more members to achieve a higher production velocity?
                    Taking the time to review the game’s production will help predict the results of the next milestone and allow you to better plan out the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are a variety of task management applications available to help facilitate production.
                    Some are as simple as paper TODO lists, sticky note scrum boards, or digital issue lists and kanban boards.
                    Others are more complex and can encompass every aspect of production, from departments, scheduling, velocity, complexity, feature criteria, task lists, dashboards, etc. Use the system that works best for you and fits your needs.
                    Pick the method that works best for you and your team size.

                <p>
                    The cost of development includes both time and money.
                    To get an idea of the costs, you need to answer the following questions:
                </p>
                <p>
                    What skills are needed to develop the game?
                    How long will it take to learn the necessary skills to develop the game?
                    Will you make the game by yourself?
                    Do you need a team?
                    How will you compensate your teammates?
                    What tools will you use?
                    Do you need to purchase licenses for software?
                    What assets will you need?
                    What is the DevOps pipeline?
                    Do you need servers to host your game?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Will your game be free or paid?
                    Will you include alternative monetization methods?
                    What devices are you targeting? 
                    What distribution platforms are you going to use? 
                    What is the production schedule?
                    How will you market your game?

                    And most importantly, How will you fund the project?
                </p>
                <p>
                    All projects require funding.
                    Whether it’s to hire other professionals, or to just keep the lights on.
                    Most people have a day job and only have their evenings and weekends available to contribute to a project.
                    People will not dedicate themselves full-time to a game project without compensation.
                    Everyone needs to pay for expenses, and it's difficult to work on something full-time without financial security.

                <h3>Funding Options</h3>
                <p>
                    If you want to work full-time on your game, there are several funding options available.
                    These include: using your savings, starting a crowdfunding campaign, partnering with publishers / investors, or applying for developer grants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For crowdfunding, publishing, and grants, you will be required to pitch your game to whomever you are seeking investment from.
                    You will want to be able to show a solid concept, often a working prototype, detailed design descriptions, captivating screenshots or videos, a definite production deadline, a breakdown on how the money will be spent, and what will be the potential Return on Investment (monetary or product).
                    The more clear, detailed, and marketable your pitch is, the greater your chances of success.

                <h3>Make a Business Plan</h3>
                <p>
                    What is the business model of your game? How will you make a Return on Investment? Investment includes both the time and money put in to finish a product. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Maybe the ROI is the experience you gained from completing the project. Your new found knowledge can be put to use in other projects, and it can help advance your career, business, or hobbies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What price will you sell your game at? What platforms will you target? Do you expect monetary gain from sales and/or publishers/investors? What revenue model will you use? Will you also include microtransactions or a subscription? Do you plan to expand the game with free or paid DLC?
                </p>
                <p>
                    But if you release a game for free and expect monetary gain, what approach will you take? Sell cosmetic goods? Sell in-game currency that can be used to purchase rolls at a gacha, or speed up actions to reduce waiting? Sell boosters to alleviate the amount of grinding a player has to do to progress? Have a subscription that gives players rewards for their participation?
                </p>
                <p>
                    For live services, how do you maintain player retention? How do you reward players and encourage them to keep playing? Do you create daily, weekly, monthly objectives? Do you host limited timed events? Do you make 1 time achievements that become increasingly more difficult?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Who is your target audience? Are you targeting a general audience that likes action or fps titles? Or is your audience more niche and into psychological horror? Either way you need to know who your audience is and make sure to direct your marketing towards them. You can do some market research and get an estimate on the market size based on the sales of previous titles within the same genre. From there you can predict expected sales projections or growth of the user base and revenue.

                <h3>Marketing and Release</h3>
                <p>
                    Marketing and advertising is critical to a game's success. The goal is to convert as many people within your target audience into buyers. Your team can make the most amazing game possible, but if nobody knows about it, then no one will play it. There are multiple avenues to spreading the word about your game and it’s development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have a publisher, they will assist your studio with traditional marketing and advertising of your game through games media outlets. Today, social media is the most common grassroots strategy to build up hype and grow an audience. Post devlogs, make screenshots and gifs, show game trailers, tell friends and family, launch a crowdfunding campaign, upload demo builds, or partnering with Let’s Players to showcase your game. Word of mouth is powerful and has the potential to make your game go viral.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For multiplayer testing, you can host Alpha and/or Beta Testing of your game. That way, fans of your game can play the game early and give you feedback before it’s released. You can use their feedback to resolve any connectivity issues and to iterate or rebalance the gameplay.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By marketing you can grow a community/following around your game. Getting people on the hype train and increasing chances of potential buyers. Hold active discussions in forums or live streams to build community growth and engagement. You will be able to gauge the size of the market for your game and better predict the success of your title.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is the potential for your game to go viral simply on the word-of-mouth generated after a game is released without any marketing. But if you want to ensure your game has a successful launch, market it before, after, and when it releases.
                </p>

                <h3>Post Mortem</h3>
                <p>
                    You’ve finished your game and released it to market. Sales numbers are rolling in and you see a surge of active users. Your team gets word from the community of various bugs and glitches in the game to iron out. The critics and users write reviews and provide feedback. Before your team continues work on the next set of patches and content drops, spend some time reflecting on the project’s success.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Post Mortems are meant to be a learning opportunity for team members. This is when you ask questions such as: Did the team meet the original production deadlines, and if not why? Did you reach your projected sales goals? How was the game received by the audience? What development processes could be improved upon? What mistakes were made that can be avoided in the future? Was the team satisfied with the work they did and did it meet quality expectations? Is there any work that was completed that can be reused for future projects? Does the team feel like they can continue working together on future projects?
                </p>
                <p>
                    It’s important to learn from your mistakes and for everyone to provide constructive criticism. Nobody is perfect, and there is plenty of room for people to grow. Take what you learned and apply it to improve the outcome of future projects.
