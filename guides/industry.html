                <h3>Overview and Highlights of the Industry</h3>
                <p>
                    The Video Game Industry is a subcategory of the Entertainment Industry. Talented individuals come together to create a product for the masses to enjoy and be entertained by. Much like movies, games go through similar phases of production. Scheduling the initial roadmap, budgeting, pre-production and concepting, early prototyping, ramping up hiring professionals and services, production and development, testing and reviewing, post-production and polish, marketing, release, ramp down. Unlike movies, games enter a sustainment period, providing updates, bug fixes, and additional content. For live-service games, the sustainment period is intended to be indefinite.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Budgets and success of games varies widely. Often, games studios funded by big publishers see widespread success. Sometimes large productions will fail and publishers have to cut their losses. Independently developed games with little to no budgets have seen both massive commercial success. While some indie games with millions of dollars are commercial flops. Or maybe game sales or player-base is small at first, but slowly ramps up overtime as the game is updated and word of mouth spreads.                </p>
                <p>
                    Games are sold on a variety of devices. Serious Games is often considered to be games sold on PC and Console platforms. Casual Games are games distributed on mobile devices or on web-platforms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Games are either released for free or at a set price tag. The game is then supplemented with either free or paid downloadable content. The games-as-service model includes various mechanisms to entice players to continually purchase paid DLC.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2018, the Game Industry achieved a global market value of $134 Billion dollars. It brings in more revenue than Film ($41B), Streaming Video on Demand ($22B), and Music ($19B). Gaming makes up a decent chunk of the entertainment industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Game Industry is broken up into 3 markets. Mobile (47%), PC (25%), and Console (28%).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Extra Reality Games (XR) are broken up into two subcategories, Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR). AR presents a virtual world on a 3D space using a device’s camera. VR lets the user see a virtual world from a first person perspective using a stereoscopic head-mounted display.

                <h3>How to Get a Job in the Game Industry</h3>
                <p>
                    In the Game Industry, studios are interested in hiring talented professionals to make a commercial product. The development team’s goal is to make a game that is fun and enjoyable. The business team’s goal is to reach as many consumers as possible and to turn a profit from game sales, downloadable content, and merchandising. Games take years to make, so there is always risk when bringing on new people mid-development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Making games is a business, so studios want to minimize risk and maximize productivity. A majority of the vacancies in industry are for mid-level and senior-level positions. There is less incentive for studios to hire interns or junior staff because training costs time and resources. Studios want you to already have the skills necessary to do the work that needs to be done. They will not hire someone that cannot prove they are competent for a role.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Along with a lack of internships and junior positions, more and more individuals are studying game development as an education or a hobby. Therefore, there is far more competition for these entry level positions. For example, the acceptance rate for an internship at Blizzard Entertainment is less than 1%. So you have to make your application standout from the rest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recruiters are looking for individuals that meet the job requirements, and can make personal connections. They will toss out any job application that doesn’t have a genuine cover letter and a portfolio of your past works. Describe your abilities or aptitude, talk about your personal experiences, and make a connection as to how your skills would be a good fit for the job. You want to portray yourself as the solution to their problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In your portfolios, show that you can program the systems that the studio needs programmed. Show that you can make art in the same art style and quality as the studio. Show that you can manage a project under a tight schedule with great organization and detail. Show that you can market games to a target audience. Show that you can manage a community and have excellent communication skills. Show that you can test games and find bugs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you currently do not have the education or skills to fulfill a developer or business role but still want to work in the Game Industry, you can work in other entry level roles. These include game testing, customer service, IT desktop support, and various facility roles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another avenue is to attend conventions. Conventions give industry professionals and fans the opportunity to come together and mingle in one place. Most conventions, such as PAX and E3, are catered more towards the fans and the marketing of upcoming games. Yet developers are present and you do have the chance to talk with them. There are also a few networking events that are held during the same week as the conventions. Your best bet for career networking in the Game Industry is at GDC, the Game Developers Conference. Companies are actively seeking to recruit individuals and do interviews on the spot. You will want to put your best foot forward and present yourself as the best candidate for an open position.

                <h3>Working in Game Testing</h3>
                <p>
                    Game testing is an entry level position where your job is to test daily builds of a game for bugs. Often you will perform general ad-hoc of certain game features, or run specific test cases to verify functionality. Sometimes, testers will be asked to perform playtests and provide feedback on the current state of the game, providing incite and suggestions. Occasionally, testers are given the opportunity to make tools for the project, or perform a more in-depth investigation into critical issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If any bugs are found, then the bugs are submitted to a bug tracking database. Producers will triage new bugs, quickly assessing whether a bug is valid, and sending it to the appropriate dev team to be fixed. Once a bug is fixed, it gets sent back to the testers to verify the fix was implemented. If a bug is verified to be fixed by a tester, then the test managers will close out the bugs. However if a tester finds that a bug is still occuring, then the test managers will send the bug back to the dev team that worked on the fix.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All game testers are required to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement. By signing the NDA, the Tester agrees to not discuss the game they are working on. If details of a game are leaked and the culprit is discovered, the tester will be reprimanded and barred from working at the studio in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Testers also perform Compliance testing in order to approve a Release Candidate build of the game.  The Release Candidate is the game build that meets all the compliance requirements, is free of any critical bugs, and will be version of the game available on the Release Date. Compliance testing is done to make sure the game meets the strict technical requirements of First-Party console platforms, and that the game will meet the targeted game rating issued by a Ratings Board. Sony’s Playstation, Microsoft’s Xbox, and Nintendo systems each have their own guidelines for legal, technical, and performance requirements.  Ratings boards, such as the ESRB and PEGI, each describe what content is suitable for various age groups.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Compliance verification is not free and the approval process takes time. So if a game fails compliance, it can cause delays in publishing and releasing the game, along with additional cost for repeat compliance testing and verification. When the game passes compliance, The Release Candidate is approved and will be the version of the game to launch on the release date. A copy of the build is sent to manufacturers to be printed on disks and shipped out to retail stores. A copy is also uploaded to digital distribution platforms as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the advent of digital downloads, games will often ship with major bugs that couldn’t be fixed before the game needed to be sent off for publishing. So development and testing will continue  so that a patch can be sent out and downloaded at launch to fix these issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Depending on a tester’s skills, aptitude, and career interests, they have the opportunity to pursue careers as a test manager, producer, developer, or community manager role.

                <h3>The Downside of Game Testing</h3>
                <p>
                    The most obvious downside to game testing is the pay. Studios tend to pay game testers minimum wage, because it is considered to be a low skill profession. Studios need as many people to manually test the game and to find as many bugs as possible. Often, game testers are hired as temporary contract workers instead of full-time employees. So not only you don’t receive the same benefits as full employees, you don’t have the same job security as they do. As a result, game testers end up making the rounds from studio to studio in areas like the bay area to keep a steady living. Even though your work in quality assurance is critical to the game’s quality and shippability, you are the least valued member of the team and are often the first to be let go when the studio ramps down production.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes the testers and developers don’t always get along. Developers may feel attacked when testers submit a bug or give feedback. Passion for the project can fog judgement and result in a lack of professionalism. Tensions rise due to miscommunication or misinterpretation, stress is high trying to meet impending deadlines, and poor decision making from lack of sleep and over working. In studios where the testers don’t interact with the developers on a daily basis, testers can feel like they are isolated and not a part of the team. Concerns brought up by the testing team can often go ignored by the development team for long periods of time. Ultimately, these issues can be a detriment to the quality of the game if they do not get addressed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Game studios have the notion that “anyone can be a game tester”. As long as they can hold a controller, record media, and type on a keyboard, you can be a game tester. But quality assurance suffers because of the lack of experience. New testers often experience difficulties using PCs and console dev kits, are unable to troubleshoot common tech issues, can misinterpret game functionality, use inefficient testing procedures, write poor bugs, have trouble querying information in a database, withhold details testing summaries, and communicate unprofessionally. New testers often receive training on such matters and are encouraged to improve their skills quickly. But, the amount of training and support provided to new QA testers varies from studio to studio.                </p>

                <h3>Departments in the Game Industry</h3>
                <p>
                    There are many departments in the games industry than just game programming and art. But, there are plenty of other roles within a game studio that most people might not be aware of. Or, people might need more insight into what are the roles available within a certain discipline.

                <h3>Culture in the Game Industry</h3>
                <p>
                    In recent years, there have been a lot of articles documenting the toxic work culture in the Game Industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Studios are taking advantage of developer’s passions and encouraging unpaid overtime. Management and peers pressure developers to participate. If you don’t, then are looked down on for not being passionate enough. Also, if you choose not to work unpaid overtime, you are more likely to be let go when the project ramps down. Crunch time lasts for a couple weeks to several months and can heavily impact work-life balance. Constantly working for 50 to 100 hrs a week can lead to fatigue from lack of sleep and mental breakdowns from heavy stress. Eventually, game developers burnout and leave the industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Only 22% of developers are women, yet those that are present have to put up with sexual harassment at studios that exhibit bro culture. Nobody should have to deal with the problems female employees faced like at Riot Games and Rockstar Games.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Developers and testers can also run into a lot of frustrations. Especially when the contracted or external and rarely interacts with the development team. This can lead to feelings of isolation and resentment as with testers at Treyarch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some studios have a tendency to let go of staff without much warning. It takes time to find a new job and get hired, so being let go on such short notice can leave you financially insecure for an unexpected period of time, like at Telltale Games. Also, businesses are always open to reducing the bottom line, even when a company is making record revenue. Large swaths of staff are fired for restructuring only for the company to rehire new employees for lower pay, as with Activision Blizzard. Game Testers often are brought on enmasse and let go after 9 to 12 months. Often, companies list contract positions because they don’t have to provide benefits and don’t have to rehire them after the alloted period, like with Electronic Arts and Epic Games. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    All these issues in the Game Industry have led many to believe that now is the time to push for unionization.

                <h3>Crunch and Game Development (WIP)</h3>
                <p>
                    Crunch is a period overtime that can last between a few weeks to several months before a game's release.
                    Although Crunch is voluntary, it is heavily encouraged that all developers participate in it.
                    Crunch is a common occurrence in games production for both AAA and indie game development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because of the creative nature of game development, some believe Crunch is an inevitable part of the Games Industry.
                    Others believe that with proper planning, decision making, and business flexibility, Crunch can be avoided.
                    Either way, passion and business success are both key factors as to why Crunch occurs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Several reasons why Crunch occurs:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            You are a well-known studio and made big promises to your fanbase that crowdfunded your game.
                            The money raised from the campaign can only be stretched for a specific amount of production time and the business can't afford extensions.
                            The scope of the game is much larger than their previous games, along with the need to create new narrative and lore.
                            Developers Crunch in order to meet the release deadline and give fans everything that was promised.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You are a well-known studio that is split working on two major titles.
                            One had a successful production, while the other is going through development hell.
                            Creative direction changes drastically, much of the game is scraped, and more work needs to be done.
                            But the deadline to release hasnt changed, so everyone has to Crunch while developers hope to get extensions.
                            Even with the extensions, developers are still Crunching all the way to the finish line.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You are a solo indie dev working on a project of massive scope.
                            It's your first game, and you are a perfectionist so you take your time with every little detail.
                            There is no one to hold you accountable for your work ethic, so you spend every waking hour working on the game.
                            At some point, you get burned out and stop working on the game for extended periods of time.
                            Multiple cycles work and burnout eventually lead to a more steady and healthy work ethic.
                            But after promising a release date of the game, you work feverishly fixing every last bug before releasing it to the world.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You are a well-known studio making a sequel to a critically-acclaimed game.
                            You think the current design is what fans want and it's going to be amazing.
                            On release, your fans criticize the game on multiple fronts and leave the development team dazed and confused.
                            New designers take the helm to overhaul the game with major design changes.
                            Developers Crunch to get all these changes made as quickly as possible to recapture the good graces of their fans.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You are well-known studio that wants to make a game in a different genre.
                            Publishing only approves one of your prototypes, although it takes place in a different setting it's still in the same genre.
                            A majority of the studio continues working on the unapproved prototype, while the developers on the approved project struggle.
                            Publishing eventually has to step in to stop the insubordination, and now the entire studio is Crunching to meet the release deadline for the approved game.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You're developnent team decided to make their next sequel with a new set of tools.
                            Although the engine is graphically impressive, it was built to make a specific genre of games.
                            Engineers have to make new tools as quickly as the can while designers struggle to work with a buggy mess.
                            Because of all the set backs, narrative changes, and large scope of an open world game, developers Crunched and had to get their publisher to give them extensions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You are a new indie studio that made a successful campaign. 
                            The money raised from the campaign can only be stretched for a specific amount of production time and the business can't afford extensions.
                            Developers Crunch from the start, because they really could not afford any extensions.
                            When the money ran out, the developers continued to work for no pay during an extension to finish the game.
                            The game was a hit success, although the game didn't have everything that was promised on launch.
                            Eventually, the developers did make an release all the promised expansions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You are well-known studio that wants to make a game in a different setting and genre.
                            You win your independence from one publisher, only to have to make a deal with another publisher.
                            The studio plans to make a game of greater scale and hire on more staff.
                            All while the game is going through an identity crisis, because none of the designers and developers can agree what the game is.
                            Eventually, some of the designers take the helm and drive the ship into a common direction. 
                            The design work from one of the prototypes is approved, but the setting is changed to match previous games.
                            The narrative is a complete mess though, and most of it get scraped and rewritten multiple times over.
                            All the developers are trying to put on the pieces together before release.
                            But after launch, fan criticism hits hard, and so new designs are made during the development of expansions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You are studio trying to prove to the world that you can make games just as big and as good as other AAA studios.
                            Designs are more ambitious, scope much larger, and the narrative going through many iterations.
                            Your studio has something to prove, so every Crunches to create the best game possible.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Your studio has to create a game that will bring a well-known studio back into good graces.
                            But the development is plagued by mismanagement at the executive level, leading to multiple waves of layoffs and hiring.
                            Along with constant creative that are encouraged by the studio's owner, and expected to be made

                <h3>Unionizing the Game Industry</h3>
                <p>
                    In order to combat the issues of unpaid overtime, job insecurity, unfair wages, discrimination, and sexual harassment, a grassroots advocacy group started called Game Workers Unite. GWU’s goal is to encourage game industry workers around the world to unionize.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unionization will allow Game Industry workers to take collective action in negotiating work hours, pay scales, and benefits with their employers. Union representatives can also help workers to take legal action for underpayment, harassment, and wrongful termination.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In France, the STJV was formed as an independent union for workers in the video games industry. 
                    In the UK, Game Workers Unite UK was formed as a branch of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB). 
                    Their purpose is to fight for better working conditions and benefits, provide legal assistance, organize strike against employers, improve diversity and inclusion, and maintain job security. 
                    The benefits of a union greatly outway the costs, with the aim of bringing about a healthier environment for game developers.
