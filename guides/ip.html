                <h3>Intellectual Property and Brands</h3> 
                <p>
                    IP - the product you provide to the market.<br>
                    Brand - the company and how they interact with the market.
                </p>
                <p>
                    IP Builder - create a uniquely emotional experience with gameplay, characters, world, story, art, etc. <br>
                    Brand Builder - communicate that emotional experience to the market that is impactful, stands out, and appeals to the target audience. They make a promise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Human beings prefer things they already have an emotional relationship with.
                    That’s why all the top-selling games are sequels or spin-offs that are a part of an existing brand.
                    Examples: Mario, Sonic, Lara Croft, Harry Potter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Start with an IP and build around it.
                    IP needs to have unique, artistic, emotional intent.
                    Have something you own, all the best ips are character based.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But, you also need to balance creativity with business.
                    Have a long-term sustainable goal for your game and company. Plan for success.

                <h3>Common Pitfalls in Development</h3>
                <p>
                    A lack of playtesting.<br>
                    People make things that can’t be tested until they are finished.
                    Artists don’t want to share their work until it is finished and perfect.
                    Start testing and iterating as soon as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not understanding the goal of playtesting.<br>
                    What is the aim during testing? What is the goal?
                    The game is fun, people keep playing it, and they invite their friends to play.
                    The Green Card: you don’t need investors, you have a business. A game that keeps people’s attention.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Devs think the publisher / investor will save them. <br>
                    Investors are business partners, not business savers.
                    Investors invest in something that you have proven to them can make money or grow an audience. And then the investor will help you take it to the next level.
                    You have to be in-touch with your audience and your aim should be to not need investors. The money you make from initial sales should cover initial costs.
                    You will need investors if you want to make future investments and/or leap into a bigger market.
                    Demonstrate that your business is already successful and keep being successful. If the investor wants to help with the process, they can join.
                    Nobody wants to get on a train that hasn’t started. They want to get on a train that’s about to leave the station.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Management and team are not on the same page.<br>
                    If all are not involved in the development process, then people will leave. You need the Brand to be built on the original artistic intent of the whole team.

                <h3>Combating Game Dev Tunnel Vision</h3>
                <p>
                    Unbiased Market Research will tell you if your marketing tactics are working (A/B Testing). <br>
                    Devs get too invested in the idea, but the market does not see the same value. What parts appeal to the audience?
                    You have to think about how to communicate the experience of a new IP to new people.
                    The market does not have the same relationship with the game as the developers currently do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Marketing to hardcore audience (selling a game Genre) is different than marketing to a mainstream audience (selling an game IP).
                    If you innovate too much, people won’t get it. Do something really well and innovate a little.
                    Interaction is a story. Gameplay mechanics are a story. What experience does it give me?                    
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="brand" class = "guide">
                <h3>Creating a lasting Brand</h3>
                <p>
                    Transition from selling gameplay, to selling emotional experiences through a series of games.
                    A strong IP can migrate to other media. Then, it becomes an Entertainment Property. Investors are thinking about this when you pitch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes the Dev Team becomes the Brand. People trust their capabilities to deliver quality games.
                    Building an IP and/or Brand improves future market success. Indies that have to compete against IPs and Brands, are put at a disadvantage.
                                       
                </p>
                <p>
                    Examples of Successful Indie Companies<br>
                    Strong IP: Shovel Knight is Yacht Club’s Shovel Knight game is a successful character based IP. Continued success has been seen through the release of sequels, spin-offs, cameos in other games, and a figurine.<br>
                    Strong Brand: After the success of FTL as Subset Games first IP, the trust in the studio as a Brand helped Into the Breach become their second successful IP.

                <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Have a character you can own.</li>
                    <li>Ask yourself, does this game have a unique emotional journey we can own? And how do we communicate it to the market?</li>
                    <li>Don’t walk too close to the trees in a forest. The market does not see your game the same way you do.</li>
                    <li>You need external advice from people who aren’t as invested in the game.</li>
