                <h2>History</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 14pt;">
                    GameDevelop.io was originally conceived as a Video Game Industry job aggregator, until several well made aggregators were discovered.
                    Realizing there was a lack of a well maintained database for game development resoruces, GameDevelop.io decided to fill that need.
                    During the construction of the resource database, it became apparent that game developers needed guidance in various aspects of game development.
                    Guides were written to teach new developers how to get started developing a game and to teach seasoned developers about business and marketing.
                    GameDevelop.io plans to continue growing the resource database, and providing helpful guides.
