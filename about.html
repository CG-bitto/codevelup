                <h2>History</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 14pt; text-align: left;">
                    GameDevelop.io was originally conceived as a job aggregator for the Video Games Industry.
                    After discovering several well made aggregators, it became apparent that there was a lack of a well maintained database for game development resoruces.
                    So, GameDevelop.io pivoted to be a resource website for game development.<br><br>
                    During the construction of the resource database, it also became apparent that indie developers needed guidance in other aspects of development.
                    So guides were written about production, business, as well as marketing.<br><br>
                    GameDevelop.io plans to continue expanding the resource database, and to provide insightful and helpful guides.
